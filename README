RT-Extension-TicketLocking

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install


To use this module, you must add the line

    use RT::Extension::TicketLocking;

to the bottom of your RT_SiteConfig.pm file.


If you want the MyLocks portlet to be available from the RT at a Glance page, you will need to 
enable it with a line like this in your RT_SiteConfig.pm file

Set($HomepageComponents, [qw(QuickCreate Quicksearch MyAdminQueues MySupportQueues MyReminders
                             RefreshHomepage MyLocks)]);

This is the default portlet list with MyLocks added to the end. People can then choose to add 
the portlet to their homepage in Preferences -> RT at a glance.


If you are running RTIR, and want the portlet to be available from the RTIR home page, you will
need to do something similar to set the RTIR_HomepageComponents array in your RTIR_Config.pm file,
like this:

Set(@RTIR_HomepageComponents, qw(
    QuickCreate
    Quicksearch
    MyAdminQueues
    MySupportQueues
    MyReminders
    /RTIR/Elements/NewReports
    /RTIR/Elements/UserDueIncidents
    /RTIR/Elements/NobodyDueIncidents
    /RTIR/Elements/DueIncidents
    /RTIR/Elements/QueueSummary
    RefreshHomepage
    MyLocks
));

This is the default RTIR portlet list with MyLocks added to the end. People can then choose to add 
the portlet to their homepage in Preferences -> RTIR Home.
