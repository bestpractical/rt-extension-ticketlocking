=head1 NAME

RT::Extension::TicketLocking - Enables users to place advisory locks on tickets

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Locks can be of several different types. Current types are:

=over 4

=item hard (manual) lock

A lock can be initiated manually by clicking the "Lock" link on one of the pages
for the ticket. However, hard locks are available only to users who can ModifyTicket.

=item take lock

This is only applicable within RTIR. See L</RTIR> section below.

=item auto lock

A lock is created whenever a user performs an action on a ticket that takes
multiple steps if a hard lock is not already in place for that ticket.

An auto lock is removed once the user is done with whatever he was doing
on the page (e.g., when he clicks "Save Changes" on the Edit page).
It is also removed if the Unlock link is clicked from a page that generated
an auto lock.

Auto-lock is set for the following actions in RT:

    - Comment
    - Reply
    - Resolve

RTIR's user may find list of actions below.

=back

Locks are advisory: if a ticket is locked by one user, other users
will be given a notification (in red) that another user has locked
the ticket, with the locking user's name and how long he has had
it locked for, but they will still be allowed to edit and submit
changes on the ticket.

When a user locks a ticket (auto lock or hard lock), they are given
a notification informing them of their lock and how long they have
had the ticket locked (in some other color - currently green).

=head2 Removing locks

Locks will remain in place until:

=over 4

=item * The user is done editing/replying/etc. (for auto locks, if
there is no hard lock on the ticket)

=item * A lock can be removed manually by clicking the "Unlock" link on one
of the pages for the ticket. This removes B<any> type of lock.

=item * The user logs out

=item * A configurable expiry period has elapsed (if the $LockExpiry
config variable has been set to a value greater than zero)

=back

When a user unlocks a ticket (auto unlock or hard unlock),
they are given a notification informing them that their
lock has been removed, and how long they had the ticket
locked for.

=head2 Merging tickets

When a locked ticket (hard or take lock) is merged into another ticket,
the ticket being merged into will get the lock type of the ticket being
merged from. This lock shift is conditional upon priority, as
usual - if the merged from ticket has a lock of a lower priority than
the merged-to ticket, the merged-to ticket will retain its lock.
If the merged-to ticket is locked by a different user, that user will
retain the lock. Basically, the merged-to ticket will retain its lock
if it is higher priority than the lock on the ticket being merged from.

=head2 RTIR

Within RTIR auto locks are applied for the following actions:

    - Edit
    - Split
    - Merge
    - Advanced
    - Reply
    - Resolve
    - Reject
    - Comment
    - Remove

As well, there is special type of lock implemented in RTIR. When a
user clicks the "Take" link for an RTIR Incident ticket, a Take lock
is added. This lock will only be removed when the IR is linked to
a new or existing Incident. If RTIR is not installed, this type
will not be available.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=head2 LockExpiry option

In the config you can set LockExpiry option to a number of seconds,
the longest time a lock can remain without being automatically removed,
for example:

    Set( $LockExpiry, 5*60 ); # lock expires after five minutes

If you don't wish to have your locks automatically expire, simply
set $LockExpiry to a false (zero or undef) value.

=head2 Allowing users to use 'MyLocks' portlet

The extension comes with a portlet users can place on thier home
page RT's or RTIR's. Using this portlet user can easily jump to
locked tickets, remove particular lock or all locks at once.

If you want the MyLocks portlet to be available then you have
to place it in the list of allowed components.

For RT:

    Set($HomepageComponents, [qw(
        MyLocks 
        ... list of another portlets ...
    )]);

People can then choose to add the portlet to their homepage
in Preferences -> 'RT at a glance'.

If you are running RTIR, and want the portlet to be available
from the RTIR home page, you will need to do something similar
to set the RTIR_HomepageComponents array in your config file,
like this:

    Set(@RTIR_HomepageComponents, qw(
        MyLocks
        ... list of another portlets ...
    ));

People can then choose to add the portlet to their homepage
in Preferences -> 'RTIR Home'.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

Each type is associated with a priority. Current priorities are as follows,
from highest priority to lowest:
    - Hard
    - Take (when applicable)
    - Auto

This allow us to store only one lock record with higher priority.
